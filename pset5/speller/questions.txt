0.  It's the longest word in the english dictionary, said to mean a certain lung disease that's caused by inhalation of very fine silica dust.
1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures for a processes or a single process.(CPU time, used memory)
2.  rusage() contains 16 members.
3.  Because if you did, you'd be copying a lot of data, which is not necesary and takes more time instead of just using pointers.(by reference)
4.  Main goes over each word until the end of the file is reached.
    the for loop keep getting the next char until end of file.(gets first char; until EOF; gets next char)
     If any non-alphabetical chars or apostrophes are found, they are not checked because they are not added to the word that will be checked.
     If alphabetical chars are found, they add it to the word and do index++
     if there's any strings that exceed the max possible length,(go over the remainder of the word while it's not EOF and not yet a new word, and reset index to zero).
     If numbers are detected, the same thing happens.(consume the remainder of the word while it's numbers and it's not EOF and index reset to zero)
     if a whole word is found, which s when index is not zero but higher, then terminate the current word and check it for spelling.
     (the time it takes to spellcheck is also benchmarked)
5.  fsncanf ignores whitespaces, which we need to check if the word has ended.(fgetc goes over every char and so is more exact, while fscanf goes over every word)
6.  Because they point to a constant character, the value of the parameter can't be changed, so basically the words can't be changed by load and check because they're declared(?) as constants in the function.
